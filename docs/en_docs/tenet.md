# Tenet

This is kind of Zen (like `Zen of Python`), but it may be not so brief and structured.

## 1. The idea of Jacy
I didn't have any need to create Jacy for my personal usage.
I just wanted to make something that I want a programming language to be.
But, anyway, the idea was to create scripting PL with expressiveness of large modern programming languages, like Swift or Kotlin.

## 2. Simplicity
Jacy is simple on both sides. Code syntax is easy to parse and easy to write.
There's nothing like ternary operator -- Jacy has `if`, and as far as `if` is an expression,
why don't use it instead of ternary operator? So, here's the main idea of simplicity.

## 3. Syntax and ambiguity
When I developed Jacy as idea, I wanted to put everything inside it, and after some time I realised that I am mostly on the side of Python rather on Ruby's.
I don't want Jacy to have multiple ways to do the same thing.
Anyway, the think I don't like in Python is that IT IS BORING, and yes, it's cool, the code of any Python programmer is pretty same to another one's.
But, Jacy must be funny to use as Ruby, so I give __one way to do something and some ways to write it__.
