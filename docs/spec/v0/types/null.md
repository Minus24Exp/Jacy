## Null type - `null`
`null` is the type that has no value. It is not null pointer, it's more similar to Python's `None` or `null` in JavaScript. \
`null` is an object but `Null` class is not accessible in language.

### Inference
`null` won't be ever inferred. The only way to use null is as value for variable that has nullable annotation (see [Nullable types](nullable.md)).
