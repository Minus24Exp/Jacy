# Types

**Important: In version 0.0.1 inference is not implemented, you need to annotate type yourself.\
The only type of inference available is in variable assignment.**

*Jacy* has strong type system, but often types can be omitted, because *Jacy* has type inference.

Despite everything is an object in *Jacy* and types are classes, all built-in types named in lowercase.\
**But by convention you must use upper-case names for classes and type-aliases.**
